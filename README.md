Collections for Lean 4
---

A solid collections library is essential to every language's ecosystem. This project aims to provide such a library for Lean 4, providing:
1. Generic interfaces for standard collections
2. Performant, correct-by-construction implementations
3. Utilities and thorough docs for easy development

See [notes.md](notes.md) for design philosophy and inspiration sources. I'm also in the process of adding docstrings to what is present here.

Very much a work in progress, always looking for help. Feel free to email me!
